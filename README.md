# MonoblocHeatPump
Data, supporting information, and Jupyter notebook for white paper titled "Real-world Efficiency of a Monobloc Heat Pump for Multi-Unit Residential Buildings" available on sustainabletechnologies.ca. The analysis notebook (the .ipynb file) may not be able to render within github due to the number of plots. Try different broswers. If it doesn't render then it may need to be downloaded (alongside the supporting data) and run in a local instance of Jupyter Notebooks.
